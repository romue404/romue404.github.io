I'm a research associate at the [Mobile and Distributed Systems Group](http://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/) at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.com) and currently pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science supervised by [Prof. Dr. Linnhoff-Popien](https://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/team/claudia-linnhoff-popien/).  
I hold a M. Sc. in computer science and a B. Sc. in media-informatics.  
As part of the  [Technology and Research on Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at LMU Munich (TRAIL)](http://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/ai-lab/) i am interested in machine learning with deep neural networks and more specifically in anomaly detection and reinforcement learning.  
Take a look at my [publications](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=mSalzCEAAAAJ) if you are interested. Besides my teaching duties, i am head of services at the [DIGITALE WELT](https://digitaleweltmagazin.de/), a magazine on digitization that is published quarterly.  
Moreover, i worked/work in industrial projects with [Stadtwerke München](https://www.swm.de/) (acoustic leak detection with neural networks) and the [Fraunhofer-Institut für Kognitive Systeme IKS](https://www.iks.fraunhofer.de/) (securing intelligent systems).
